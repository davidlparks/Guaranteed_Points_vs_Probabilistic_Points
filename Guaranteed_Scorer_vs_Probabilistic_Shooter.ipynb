    "If you are like most people, after a few seconds of thought you would instinctively pick Player 2. Scoring 20 guaranteed points per game is tough to beat. In fact, if Player 2 did this throughout his entire career, he would be number 70 on the points per game all-time leaderboard according to basketball-reference.com[1](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_per_g_career.html). However, if Player 2 squared off against Player 1, Player 1 would win more games, all else being equal. And winning, not scoring, is more important to the team - your instincts failed you.  \n",
